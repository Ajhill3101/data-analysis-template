# Part 1 Project Answers

## Data Description
The data Austin and I selected is from two different datasets. The first dataset is derived from Project Tycho, a global health database compiling a wealth of data resources for common global health burdens in over 90 different countries. Due to the political discourse surrounding the current measles vaccine, and Austin and I being invested as infectious disease researchers, we honed in on the measles dataset. This measles data compiles 436,932 cases collected through the US Nationally Notified Disease Surveillance System. This data was collected weekly, and includes other variables such as place of acquisition, mortality outcome, cumulative nature and age range. This data can further be broken down by the state/U.S. territory in which the case was reported. The second set of data we are looking to use is a compilation of multiple measles record collections from the CDC amidst the current outbreaks being seen in the U.S. This data describes recent case reports for measles outbreaks from 2023-2026 broken down by state, yearly cases of measles in the United States from 1985-2026, and data on MMR vaccination rates amongst kindergarteners broken down by state from 2009-2025.

## The Question
After discussion, Joe and I came up with the following question: "What factors might explain the current measles outbreaks seen in the U.S." In particular, we are curious to explore whether past trends in persistent measles cases and vaccination coverage explain the trends we see in particular states acting as outbreak hubs in the U.S.. We are interested in seeing if there are any states which show persistent measles incidence over time from the early 1980s to 2000s and whether this might predict certain states as candidate states for outbreaks. We are also interested in investigating trends of MMR vaccination in kindergarteners and test whether this can predict a state prime for a measles outbreak. We are looking for patterns of specific states that are having current measles outbreaks in 2024-26 (South Carolina, Texas, etc.) having past trends in measles persistence or vaccination struggles as an explanation as to why they are having these outbreaks. 

## Suggestions for analysis
Our vision for analysis would look to assign a mean value for vaccination rate across the sampled data and run a linear regression analysis to see if a lower vaccination rate amongst kindergartener correlates with a high measles incidence rate between 2024-26. Also, after some searching around, we think it would be interesting to try to run an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, which is used to predict future data from time series data. We think it would be interesting to implement this with the 1980s to 2000s measles case data from Project Tycho to identify any states with low-level persistent measles cases, as these states would likely predict to have a future measles burden whereas other states would predict to have no case burden. We are unsure of how complicated this could be, but could be interesting to try!

## Background Information for the Question
As you may know, measles is becoming a major problem again in the United States. Measles was once eliminated in the United States in 2000, but it has since made headlines in recent years for major outbreaks amongst children. Much of this is proposed to be due to lower MMR vaccination rates, but we wonder if there might be additional explanation from past trends in measles incidence. There have been studies which look at predictor variables as indicators of states that may have measles outbreaks, including MMR vaccination rate, population of the county, and international air travel data, but very little attention has been directed at historical data and whether trends of past persistent measles incidence could explain states having current outbreaks.

# Introduction 

## General Background Information
_Provide enough background on your topic that others can understand the why and how of your analysis_ 

## Description of data and data source
The three datasets used in this study comes from two different sources. The first dataset, which looks at historical measles case rates from as early as the late 1800s, is sourced from Project Tycho, an open-access global health data resource offered and maintained by the University of Pittsburgh. This data repository offers a large set of pre- and self-compiled data spanning a variety of pathogenic diseases. This study self-compiled a measles dataset, sourced from the United States Nationally Notifiable Surveillance System, spanning 352,518 non-cumulative cases recorded from the 50 United States and multiple U.S. territories, including American Samoa, Guam, Northern Marina Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia. These cases cover an age range of 0-130 years of age and provides a number of cases reported within a given period start and end date. The second and third datasets were derived from the CDC's website on measles cases and outbreaks: https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html. This resource offered two datasets analyzed in this study. First, a simple data table of detected measles cases in the 50 United States from 2024-2026. The second dataset is a data table compiling MMR vaccination rates in the 50 United States from 2009 through 2025. This data compiles 286,000 kindergarteners who reported receiving an MMR vaccine during the school year. This data is broken down based on the state, estimated vaccination rate, population size and the survey type used to obtain this data.

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
Through this analysis, we are investigating whether historical measles incidence can be a predictor for emerging measles cases/outbreaks and current trends in vaccination. Taking inspiration from what history can teach us, we are curious if trends in measles incidence from the 1980s through early 2000s can explain why certain states are having major outbreaks of measles and if this is related to vaccine hesitancy in these states. We hypothesize that states with shorter-lived burdens are more hesitant to vaccinate, due to it being normalized in their community as measles being a less severe threat. This normalization of measles as not a concern for their community then subsequently creates hesitancy to vaccinate, and we hypothesize that this trend in less vaccination correlates with states having outbreaks of measles cases in 2024-2026.

## Schematic of workflow

Sometimes you might want to show a schematic diagram/figure that was not created with code (if you can do it with code, do it). @fig-schematic is an example of some - completely random/unrelated - schematic that was generated with BioRender.
We store those figures in the `assets` folder.

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic
#| fig-cap: "A figure that is manually generated and shows some overview/schematic. This has nothing to do with the data, it's just a random one from one of our projects I found and placed here."
#| echo: FALSE
```




## Data acquisition
Data was obtained from Project Tycho and the CDC as previously mentioned. In brief, CDC data was downloaded from their weekly updated repository. Data was downloaded on February 3, 2026[1]. Non-cumulative measles case data from Project Tycho[2] was downloaded with the following parameters: Condition = measles, Source name = US Nationally Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, Interval Type = Week, Cumulative = No.


## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._

Data import/cleaning is mostly done, so for now we will include a brief summation of what we have done:
- imported data using read_csv (all datasets)

### MMR Vaccination Data By State (CDC)
- standardize state names
- create a new column that extracts year from starting period date
- remove % from numbers in estimated percent vaccinated column
- Collapse data to one row per state

### CDC Measles 2024-26 Data
- rename columns (location -> state, year_raw -> cases)
- remove NA values from state and year columns

### Project Tycho Historical Measles Data
- Convert weekly totals to yearly totals by state
- Add column that looks at longest streaks of consecutive years with measles cases
- Remove US territories with incomplete data

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project._

![Example figure Austin and Joe have generated](unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)

@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below. I generally recommend the `here` package.

```{r}
#| figure: recent peak measles cases versus historical peak measles burden
#| tbl-cap: "Recent peak measles cases versus historical peak measles burden."
#| echo: FALSE
```



## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._


@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
```
